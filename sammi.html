                    <h2>SAMMI</h2>
                    <!-- <h5>Also Known as<span>KALIYATTAM</span></h5> -->
                    <P>Sammi Dance is a folk dance of the Punjab state of India. It originated from the tribal communities of Punjab and is performed by the women of Baazigar, Rai, Lobana and Sansi tribes. The costume of this dance is colourful and it's a treat to experience sammi dance. The dancers usually dress themselves in bright coloured kurtas and full flowing skirts called lehengas.

                        Performance of Sammi Dance
                        The performance of sammi dance is like that of Giddha dance and it is practiced only by women. The dancers stand in a circular mode and swing their hands, bringing them up from the sides, right in front up to the chest level and clap: they take their hands down in accordance with the rhythm and clap again. Repeating this gesture, they bend forward and clap again and go round and round in a circle. As the rhythm is maintained with the beat of the feet, various swinging movements are performed with the arms. Most of the gestures are confined to the movement of the arms, by clicking and clapping.
