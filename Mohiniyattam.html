                    <h2>MOHINIYATTAM</h2>
                    <!-- <h5>Also Known as<span>KALIYATTAM</span></h5> -->
                    <P>Mohiniyattam (Mohiniattam) is a classical dance form of Kerala in South India. The origin and
                        popularity of this dance form is closely tagged to the great Tamil dance master Vadivelu, one of
                        the Thanjavur quartets. One among the eight Indian classical dance forms, Mohiniyattam is a
                        graceful dance to watch and is a solo recital by women. The term Mohiniyattam comes from the
                        words mohini meaning a woman who enchants onlookers and aattam meaning graceful and sensuous
                        body movements. Thus, the word Mohiniyattam literally means - dance of the enchantress.

                        Mohiniyattam has a legend attached to it as per the Hindu mythology. It says that, after the
                        ocean of milk was churned jointly by the gods and the demons to extract the elixir of life, the
                        demons took the divine brew by force. Following the incident, Lord Vishnu came to the rescue of
                        the gods. He allured the demons by taking the form of a woman with outstanding beauty called
                        Mohini and stole the elixir of life from them and handed it to the gods. The enticing acts of
                        Mohini are reflected in the dance form of Mohiniyattam.</P>
