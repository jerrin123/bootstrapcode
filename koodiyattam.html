                    <h2>KOODIYATTAM</h2>
                    <!-- <h5>Also Known as<span>KALIYATTAM</span></h5> -->
                    <P>The ancient Sanskrit theatrical art form of the state, Kutiyattam is Kerala’s distinctive stage
                        interpretation of the very early Sanskrit drama as dance drama. Kutiyattam (Koodiyattam), which
                        is around 2000 years old, has been accepted as one of the 'Masterpieces of Oral and Intangible
                        Heritage of Humanity' by the UNESCO. It is usually performed only in temple theatres known as
                        Koothambalam by members of the Chakyar and Nambyar castes till the first half of the 20th
                        century. Only through rigorous training lasting many years one can aspire to master the craft of
                        Kutiyattam.

                        The word Kutiyattam literally means "acting together". There are four methods or types of acting
                        has been mentioned in Sage Bharata’s Natya Shastra – aangikam (expression using different parts
                        of the body), vaachikam (expression through speech), sathvikam (expression of physical reactions
                        to emotions) and aahaaryam (expression through costume, ornaments and props) are all woven into
                        Koodiyattam performances. A typical Koodiyattam performance involves elaborate and lengthy
                        acting sequences using hand gestures and distinctive modes of acting like Ilakiyaattom,
                        Pakarnnaatttom and Irunnaattom.</P>
